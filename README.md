## Overview

This juypter notebook is run from top down, it is a simulation of the irish emegency call centre using Python Poisson distribution. Numpy seed values are used to ensure the simulated data is the same each time the notebook is run. 

## Problem Statement

This section describes the problem statement, to simulate a real world phenomeon using Numpy random package in Python

## Real World Phenomenon 

In this section the real world phenomenon that we are going to simulate is discussed

## Variables

The variables used in the simulated are discussed and how they will be simulated

## Building the Dataframe

This section discusses how the parts of the dataset dataframe is built and how it is joined together to make the overall dataset dataframe

## Analysing the Dataset

In this section we discuss the resulting dataset simulated data and from the resulting data simulation.
